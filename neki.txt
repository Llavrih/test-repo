Ključne besede: digitalni dvojček, okvir za implementacijo, faza obratovanja in vzdrževanja
Izvleček:
Stopnje sprejemanja konceptov in tehnologij digitalnega dvojčka (angl. DT - Digital Twin) v arhitekturi,
iženirstvu in gradbeništvu (AEC) so se znatno povečale v celotnem življenjskem ciklu projekta od
dobave do faze delovanja in vzdrževanja (angl. O&M - Operation and Maintance). To je posledica
potencialnih in dokazanih koristi DT za izboljšanje učinkovitosti in produktivnosti upravljanja sredstev,
zlasti med fazo O&M.
Empirični dokazi kažejo, da koncepti in tehnologije DT omogočajo pametno upravljanje fizičnih
sredstev, če se izvede integracijo vseh ključnih podatkov O&M, ki prikazujejo statuss sredstev v
realnem času. Vendar pa zaradi pomanjkanja smernic in standardnih postopkov za DT ni moč v celoti
izkoristiti potenciala tehnologij DT za upravljanje in vzdrževanje O&M. Ob upoštevanju te ovire to
raziskovalno delo presoja in analizira najsodobnejše tehnologije DT v okviru podrobnega prelgeda
literature v kombinaciji s študijami primerov in demonstracijami okvirnih aplikacij z uporabo
programske opreme/platform DT (Dalux FM).
Cilj te raziskovalne študije je oblikovati in predlagati optimalno raven okvira DT, ki se se lahko
uporablja v fazi obratovanja in vzdrževanja O&M. Predstavljeni okvir DT vzpostavlja tudi jasen
postopek izvajanja teoretičnega DT med fazo delovanja in vzdrževanja, ki lahko vodi do inovativnega
upravljanja osnovnih fizičnih sredstev.

Title: Theoretical application of framework for Digital twin for operation and
maintenance phase
Document type: Master Thesis
Scope and tools: 100p., 61 fig., 12 tab., 3 ann.
Keywords: Digital twin, framework implementation, operation, and maintenance phase
Abstract:
The adoption rates of digital twin (DT) concepts and technologies in the architecture, engineering, and
construction (AEC) sectors have significantly risen throughout the project lifecycle from the delivery to
the operation and maintenance (O&M) phase. This is due to the potential and proven benefits of DT
technologies to improve the efficiency and productivity of asset management, particularly during the
O&M phase.
The empirical evidence shows that DT concepts and technologies enable smart asset management by
integrating all the O&M data to provide the real-time status of the assets. However, due to a lack of
guidance and standard processes for DT implementation, the AEC industry is not able to fully leverage
the potential of DT technologies for asset management during the O&M phase. Considering this barrier,
this research work evaluates and analyses the state-of-the-art DT technologies through literature analysis
combined with case studies and demonstrations of framework applications using the DT
software/platforms (Dalux FM).
The objective of this research study is to design and propose the optimum level of DT framework
applicable during the O&M phase. The presented DT framework also establishes the clear process of
Theoretical DT implementation during the operation and maintenance phase that may lead to innovative
smart asset management.

1 INTRODUCTION
The Era of Industry 4.0 has brought significant progress in innovation and technology forefront, enabling
the wide spectrum of industries to embrace digital technologies such as digital twin concepts to improve
productivity and competitive advantage through its process enhancement. Ushering into industry 4.0 has
promised significant value in terms of digital solutions that have never been possible prior to the advent
of connected, smart technologies (Deloitte, 2020). The digital twin concepts allow the industry to
maintain the complete digital footprint of the product throughout its lifecycle and most importantly
achieve customer requirements/satisfactions through the realization of customized products, improved
operation, and maintenance, reducing the rework and defects, solving the physical problem faster
through early detections, predict an outcome with higher accuracy and ultimately achieving the better
service and cost optimization to the customer (Adriaanse, Arjen et al., 2021)
The adoption of digital technologies in the architecture, engineering & construction (AEC) sector has
been slow mainly attributable to the nature of construction activities and a high degree of fragmentation
within the AEC industry. However, with the increasing adoption of Building Information Modelling
(BIM) by the AEC sectors, effective coordination among the fragmented stakeholders becomes possible
due to BIM acting as the central repository for collating digital information about a project. The benefits
of BIM adoption in the design and delivery phase have already been proven and widely practiced.
However, the BIM adoption in the asset management areas during the operation and maintenance
(O&M) phase has been limited. According to (Boje et al., 2020), This is partly due to the lack of
awareness of BIM capabilities in facility management, poor data integration between BIM and IoT
technologies, and also interoperability issues associated with legacy formats of BIM. Another
researcher, (Lu et al., 2020a) cited the misalignment and complexity of the asset management framework
with the BIM information management system. (Adriaanse, Arjen et al., 2021) stressed that, intensive
use of advanced digital solutions is the only way to increase the productivity of the sector to innovate
much faster. BIM implementation has set the initial step/environment toward digitalization of the AEC
sectors by enabling visualization, coordination, simulation, optimization, and the ability to manage some
degree of semantic data (Quaye, G.M, 2021). The possibilities of BIM integrations with other computing
environments such as the internet of things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning (ML)
have the abilities to improve predictability, enhance decision making through real-time collaboration
and enhance information flow throughout the project life cycle, optimize energy consumptions, improve
hazard and risk mitigation, etc. (Quaye, G.M, 2021) (Maskuriy, et al., 2019).
The most simplistic definition of a digital twin (DT) is defined as '' a digital replica of a real-world
entity connected by bidirectional information and data flow'' (Opoku et al., 2022). DT is fundamentally
referred to as a concept driven by sets of technologies such as artificial intelligence, machine learning,
and data analytics and creates digital shadows that can provide insight and learning to the physical

counterpart. (Lu et al., 2020a). Unlike BIM, DT has the capabilities to pull the data from heterogeneous
sources to perform data analytics such as prior scenario simulations on the test bed before the installation
of a physical asset and verify the as-built conditions.
The focus of the thesis is to conduct a comprehensive digital twin state-of-the-art review in the area of
BIM-enabled asset management during the O&M phase, review the standards, good practice, and
framework applied for the DT application in the O&M phase, and conduct the case study on the thematic
area using the available platforms and software applications. The final goal of this study is to propose
an adequate level of DT framework for implementing the DT concepts and technologies for the O&M
phase.
1.1 Problem Statement
BIM adoption is largely confined to the delivery phase of the project which acts as the central repository
for collating digital information about a project. However, its associated benefits and capabilities in the
asset operation and maintenance phase is still limited and seen as evolving profile (Quaye, G.M, 2021).
The reason for the limitations of BIM asset management maturity is attributable to reasons such as the
legacy format of BIM, and the interoperability issue. The digital twin concepts have brought many
capabilities to enhance the limitations posed by the current BIM asset management process.
BIM-enabled asset management requires asset-related data to be collected during the design
construction phase for the intended purpose of the facility management goal envisioned. This is mainly
done using the Cobie process (construction operation building information exchange format). This asset
data are further transferred to various Facility Management (FM) information systems, such as EMS
(energy management systems), CMMS (computerized maintenance management systems), BAS
(building automation systems), EDMS (electronic document management systems), (Halmetoja and
Lepkova, 2022). However, these systems lack the interoperability and visualization capabilities required
for smart asset management.
The goal of this thesis is to investigate the state-of-the-art asset management process using the BIM
digital twin framework to improve the performance of asset management by evaluating each aspect of
the asset management realm classified under technology-related issues, information-related issues, and
organization-related issues. This evaluation shall be further aligned to international asset management
standards -55000 and other regional best practices of Gemini Principal developed by digitally built
Britain (dBB), CDBB. The ultimate goal is to develop a digital twin framework with the right level of
information requirements and level of details/development for the practical application of digital twins
in the operation and maintenance phases.

2 DEFINITION OF DIGITAL TWIN
2.1 Historical Overview of Digital Twin
According to (Pronost et al., 2021), The first trace of digital twins dates back to between 1967 and 1972
when NASA launched the first Appolo 13 mission. Based on the historical record, NASA engineers
built a replica of spacecraft on Earth to train the astronaut in a simulated environment before the mission
to predict the different probable scenarios of the flight and finally find out the solutions to solve the
problem remotely in case it happened. With the mirrored physical model and simulated environment,
NASA was able to safely land the crippled spacecraft using a physical model solution when the
spacecraft faced an emergency battery failure. This twin concept, applied by NASA, is the first evidence
that a physical object provides information to its virtual counterpart. However, according to (van der
Valk et al., 2020), no real connection was made between digital representations and the physical object.
The separate physical object was stationed on the ground simulated by the digital environment to
stimulate solution in the event of a problem faced by the spacecraft and transmit the solution to the
astronaut for manual application. Thus, the direct connections between the physical object and its digital
representations have not been achieved (Pronost et al., 2021).
PLM concepts were proposed by Dr. Michael Grieves at the University of Michigan (2003) as the
equivalent of virtual digital representations for physical products (Hu et al. al., 2021). This model was
described as a'' Mirrored spaced model'' instead of on digital twin (DT) (Pronost et al., 2021). The PLM
model comprises both an actual physical system and a new virtual replica, hosting all the data of the
physical artifact. This is referred to as the "twinning" or "mirroring" of an actual physical system
throughout its life with a connected virtual system (Quaye, G.M, 2021)
Figure 2. Product Lifecycle Management (Grieves, 2006)
In 2012, NASA formally defined the term "Digital Twin" (DT), recognizing the enormous potential it
has for the discipline of aerospace engineering (Bhatti et al., 2021). Since then, extensive study has been
conducted to determine how digital twin concepts might be used practically in fields other than

aeronautical engineering. Digital conceptions were generally stationary and confined to a few sectors,
such as aerospace and manufacturing, between 2013 and 2017. This is explained by the technologies
necessary to put them into practice, including information and communication technology, sensor and
monitoring technology, the Internet of Things (IoT), and big data simulation and analysis technology,
according to Pronost et al. (2021). With the advent of Industry 4.0 and the development of fields like
Big Data or the Internet of things, these needs cannot be met (IoT). Large amounts of data may be
collected and processed due to technological advancements in this domain, making it feasible to acquire
important information. (Pronost et al., 2021). DT was ranked among the most promising technologies
for the upcoming decades by Gartner in 2017 and 2019. (Kumar and Teo, 2021).
Figure 3. Historical evolution of Digital Twin. (Hu et al., 2021)
2.2 Theoretical Aspect of Digital Twin
A digital twin is a hype term. It is often used in today's discussions about digitalization, smart production,
and industry 4.0 (Peng et al., 2020). Based on the literature review of digital twin (DT) terminology and
concepts, the definition of digital twins varies depending on the industry/domain and its purpose/usage.
All industries have defined the digital twin according to their specific domain perspectives, However,
most terminology overlaps with some specific to their industries. Some of the definitions of digital twin
from prominent industries players are mentioned below;

(Autodesk, 2021) "A digital twin is a dynamic, up-to-date replica of a physical asset that brings
together design, construction, and operational data. With the addition of realtime operational data, digital twins acquire the behavioral awareness necessary
to simulate, predict and inform decisions based on real-world conditions"
Siemens "A digital twin is a virtual representation of a physical product or process, used
to understand and predict the physical counterpart’s performance
characteristics. Digital twins are used throughout the product lifecycle to
simulate, predict, and optimize the product and production system before
investing in physical prototypes and assets".

"A digital twin (DT) - also referred to as digital shadow, digital replica or digital
mirror - is a digital representation of a physical asset. Linked to each other, the
physical and digital twins regularly exchange data throughout the PBOD
lifecycle and use phase. Technology like AI, machine learning, sensors, and
IoT allows for dynamic data gathering and right-time data exchange to take
place".
Wikipedia "A digital twin is a virtual representation that serves as the real-time digital
counterpart of a physical object or process''.
SPHERE "A Digital Twin is a dynamic, virtual representation of a building, its assets,
processes, and system".
IBM ''A digital twin is a virtual representation of an object or system that spans its
lifecycle, is updated from real-time data, and uses simulation, machine
learning, and reasoning to help decision-making''.
According to (Hu et al., 2021), the definition of DT illustrated above in different applied fields reveals
the following commonalities;
- The foundational element of DT includes a physical object, virtual counterpart, and
connection between them implicitly and explicitly.
- Data transmission between the physical artifact and the digital model is highlighted.
2.3 Industrial evolution (Industry 4.0)
Industry 4.0 was conceptualized based on the fourth industrial revolution that has taken place in the
manufacturing industry (Ghobakhloo, 2020). Industry 4.0 has contributed to significant digitalization of
the manufacturing industry impacting the entire value chain. One of the biggest innovations of industry
4.0 was digital twins concepts and technologies that were widely adopted by many industries (Quaye,
7 Dorji, T. 2022. Theoretical application.... framework for DT for operation and maintenance phase
 Master Thesis Ljubljana, UL FGG, Second cycle Master study Programme Building Information Modelling – BIM A+.
G.M, 2021). Industry 4.0 promotes an open, smart manufacturing platform for industrial-networked
information applications. Real-time data monitoring, tracking of the status and positions of the product
smart control of production processes are some of the outcomes achieved through the application of DT
concepts and technologies. (Vaidya et al., 2018).
Figure 4. The great industrial revolutions, (Ghobakhloo, 2020)
According to (Maskuriy et al., 2019), The first industrial revolution started with water and steampowered engine (1784), the second industrial revolution was mass production powered by electric
energy (1870), and the third revolution started a program logic circuits (PLC), and information
technologies (IT) systems (1969). During the same era, the AEC industry evolved with computer-aided
design (CAD), and prefabrications and gradually entered into the 3D design (object-oriented design).
The era of industry 4.0 started in the year 2011 with a higher level of value and control which was not
possible in the prior era (Vaidya et al., 2018). In the manufacturing sectors, more innovative processes
and control emerged such as smart machines, smart factories, and Cyber-Physical Systems (Quaye,
G.M, 2021). Industry 4.0 enables smarter ways of manufacturing production in the factory through
integrations of multiple connected systems. The triggering technologies were Digital Twins, IoT,s,
sensors, big data, cloud computing, systems integration, AR/VR, and simulation engines (Quaye, G.M,
2021).
Big Data and Analytics; Real-time decision-making will increasingly rely on the gathering and
processing of data from heterogeneous sources, including customers, business management systems,
and production equipment or systems. The record indicates four components that make up big data:
quantity, variety, speed of creation and analysis of new data, and value of the data (Vaidya et al., 2018).
Dorji, T. 2022. Theoritical application..... framework for DT for operation and maintenance phase 8
Master Thesis. Ljubljana, UL FGG, Second cycle Master Study Programme Building Information Modelling – BIM A+.
Data analysis of previously collected data is used to identify threats that have previously happened in
various production processes in the industry, forecast new concerns, and provide potential solutions to
prevent them from happening repeatedly (Maskuriy et al., 2019).
Autonomous Robots; In locations where human workers are not allowed due to several risks, an
autonomous robot is employed to carry out autonomous manufacturing procedures with more accuracy.
Robots that operate autonomously may execute tasks quickly and accurately while putting a strong
emphasis on teamwork, flexibility, and safety. (Vaidya et al., 2018).
Simulation: The physical environment, including processes, machines, products, and people, is
replicated in a virtual model using real-time data. This improves decision-making by allowing for
insights obtained from various parameter adjustments and visualization. For virtual commissioning,
simulation of cycle times, energy usage, or ergonomic features of a production facility, 2D and 3D
simulations can be produced saving huge amounts of cost and time. It is possible to reduce product
failures during the startup phase and shorten downtimes by using simulations of production processes.
Additionally, to increase the robustness of processes, simulations are utilized to reflect what-if scenarios
(Quaye, G.M, 2021).
System Integration: Three types of integration primarily characterize Industry 4.0: (a) horizontal
integration throughout the entire value chain, (b) vertical integration and networked manufacturing
systems, and (c) end-to-end engineering throughout the lifecycle. Automation of vertical and horizontal
manufacturing processes includes entirely digital integration, automation, and communication (Quaye,
G.M, 2021).
The Internet of Things; Internet of things (IoT) stands for a worldwide network of interconnected and
uniform addressed objects that communicate via standard protocols (Vaidya et al., 2018). The main
purpose of IoT is to support data sharing and enable seamless communication from the physical
environment through sensor networks with the digital counterpart. The emergence of IoT technologies
aided many industries to achieve automation in their field. (Kumar, et al., 2019).
Cloud-based platform; Serves as a technical backbone for the connection and communication of
elements essential in the DT. Companies generate a tremendous quantity of data during their lifecycle.
These data are frequently shared within and outside the organization for multiple reasons. Building the
own database and server to host the data shall result in significant cost implications both for
infrastructure and maintenance. Therefore, a cloud-based platform is regarded as one of the most
essential components necessary for DT operation. Other technologies associated with the fourth
industrial revolution are augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) (Vaidya et al., 2018).

2.4 General Concepts of Digital Twin
2.4.1 DT Model
According to (Boje et al., 2020), the concepts of the DT can be expressed using three main components
which include the following,
1) Physical elements
2) Connected data
3) Virtual counterpart
Figure 5. Digital twin paradigm. (Boje et al., 2020)
The features and applications of digital twin models across industries are largely similar in design,
delivering dynamic and real-time data for planning and controlling activities. (Boje et al., 2020), The
connecting loop between the Virtual to Physical system and the data in various forms is the fundamental
component of any digital twin model. The data traveling from the Physical object to the virtual comes
in raw format and required some amount of processing, on the contrary, data moving from the digital
model to the physical objects are subjected to several transformations. These data are regarded as
processed information from data analytics and stored knowledge in digital models. The final output of
analyzed data is pushed back to the Physical system through human interventions or automatic
mechanical actuators. Essentially, the real-world data fed from physical systems to the virtual models
are being processed and analyzed based on embedded engineering models to manage the physical
object/asset efficiently.

Master Thesis. Ljubljana, UL FGG, Second cycle Master Study Programme Building Information Modelling – BIM A+.
2.4.2 DT Classifications
According to Wikipedia,(“Digital twin,” 2022), '' A digital twin (DT) concept is classified into the
following types;
Digital Twin Prototype (DTP); DTP includes the design, analysis, and processes to create a physical
product. DTP existed before the physical product.
Digital Twin Instance (DTI); DTI is a digital copy of a solo version of a product after the product is
manufactured.
Digital Twin Aggregate (DTA); A DTA is an aggregation of DTIs whose data and information can be
used for querying, predicting, and understanding the physical product. The specific information
contained in digital twins is determined by use cases. The digital twin is only a logical construct and
does not necessarily contain the data and information in itself. The actual data and information may be
stored in other applications connected through semantic meaning and ontology relationships (“Digital
twin,” 2022).
(Pronost et al., 2021) developed further classifications of DT based on their maturity level (digital model,
digital shadow, digital twin) and integration level. The decision tree of the Digital Twins subcategories
used is shown below;
Figure 6. DT classifications framework (Own work)
(1) Pre-Digital Twin; This version of DT contains only a digital model; There are no physically
existing object counterparts yet. This model can only be created using the theoretical data
11 Dorji, T. 2022. Theoretical application.... framework for DT for operation and maintenance phase
 Master Thesis Ljubljana, UL FGG, Second cycle Master study Programme Building Information Modelling – BIM A+.
provided at the model's input. Before the actual system is implemented, this form of DT is
generally created during the design phase to test the design outcomes and reduce potential risks.
(2) Digital Model; Any digital depiction of a physical item that "does not use any sort of automated
data interchange between the physical object and the digital object" is referred to as a digital
model (Fuller et al., 2020). This class of digital twins has a physical counterpart, unlike preDT. It is possible to feed a digital object with measured data from the input and output of the
real system and compare the reliability of its output response to that of the real system. . The
digital model enables comparison between the virtual representation of the object it represents
and the actual object to ensure accuracy.
(3) Digital Shadow; According to (Fuller et al., 2020), A digital shadow is a virtual representation
with a singular automatic data stream, such that when the actual object changes, the digital copy
is updated automatically. However, reverse dataflow is limited. Instead of automated feedback
loops caused by changes in the digital representation that are based on simulations, changes to
the physical system only come about as a result of more conventional human judgments. Its
uses include predictive maintenance and real-time operation visualization.
(4) Digital Twin; Digital twins are composed of a physical entity and a digital entity which are
connected via a network to allow for seamless connectivity and continuous information sharing
via direct physical communication or through indirect connections based on the cloud. The
automatic input to the virtual object enables the dynamic updating of the model. The goal is
then accomplished by using the model to create an effective command for the physical
equivalent of the virtual object. DTs can optimize processes carried out by the actual system,
such as manufacturing operations optimization.
Figure 6. DT Classifications based on Dataflow (Own work)
According to Autodesk, digital twins are created at different levels of assets in a scalable manner
beginning from a single component to an asset, process, system, or network of the system for the entire
city or country;

Figure 7. DT types (Autodesk, 2021)
2.4.3 DT Characteristics
As per (Singh et al., 2021), some of the common DT features and characteristics are summarized below;
High-fidelity; This is governed by the standard of the parameters, their correctness, and the extent to
which virtual and physical counterparts have been separated from one another. A highly realistic digital
model aids DT in accurately reflecting every feature of its actual twin (Singh et al., 2021). When given
a variety of potential outcomes or scenarios, highly detailed DT makes simulation and prediction
systems more accurate (Jones et al., 2020).
Figure 8. Digital twin features (Deloitte, 2020)
13 Dorji, T. 2022. Theoretical application.... framework for DT for operation and maintenance phase
 Master Thesis Ljubljana, UL FGG, Second cycle Master study Programme Building Information Modelling – BIM A+.
Dynamic; The dynamic aspect is signified by its response relative to time. DT model should be capable
of changing the physical system as per a change in physical parameters or inputs fed either manually or
automatically (dynamic data, historical static data). This is enabled through the seamless exchange of
dynamic data continuously between the physical and virtual models. The dynamic nature of DT is
indicated by its ability to realistically mimic the physical twin in the digital world
Self-evolving; DT changes throughout its life cycle along with its physical counterpart. A closed
feedback loop results from any change in either the physical or digital counterpart reflecting itself in the
other. With the support of the data gathered by the physical object in real-time, DTs are capable of selfadapting and self-optimizing, evolving throughout their existence alongside their physical counterparts
(Barricelli et al., 2019).
Multiscale and Multiphysical; The properties of the physical twin must be integrated into DT, which
is a virtual clone of its physical twin, on one or more levels. As a result, the virtual model in DT is based
on the physical pair's macro-geometric characteristics, such as shape, size, tolerance, etc (Singh et al.,
2021). DT is also multiphysical because in addition to the aforementioned geometric characteristics, the
model is also based on the physical characteristics of the physical twin, including material characteristics
like stiffness, strength, hardness, and fatigue strength as well as structural dynamics models,
thermodynamic models, stress analysis models, and fatigue damage models.
Multidisciplinary; The primary aspect of Industry 4.0 is the digital twin Which evolved as the result
of multidisciplinary fields such as information technology, computer science, electrical, mechanical,
electronic, and communications.
2.4.4 Digital Twin Process

Master Thesis. Ljubljana, UL FGG, Second cycle Master Study Programme Building Information Modelling – BIM A+.
Create; To conduct critical measurements of the input from the physical process and its surroundings,
the first step is to equip the physical process with a variety of sensors. Two types of sensor measurements
are deployed. (1) Performance indicators of the physical standards set for an asset, (2) External data
influencing the performance of physical assets. Sensor readings are transferred to the digital twin after
being encoded into secure digital signals. Process-based information from systems like manufacturing
execution systems, enterprise resource planning systems, CAD models, and supply chain systems can
be included to improve sensor signaling. As a result, the digital twin will have a stream of data that is
continuously updated for use as input in its analysis.
Communicate; Communication between the physical process and the digital platform facilitates
seamless, real-time, bidirectional integration and connectivity. One of the revolutionary innovations that
made the digital twin possible is network communication, which consists of three main parts: Edge
processing, Interfaces for communication, and Edge Safety
Aggregate; Data is processed and prepared for analysis and can be imported into a data warehouse.
Data processing and aggregation are possible both on-premises and on cloud platforms. Recent
advancements in the fields of technology that support data collection and processing have made it
possible for architects to design designs that scale more quickly and inexpensively than in the past.
Analyze; Data analysis and visualization are done. Advanced analytics platforms and technologies can
be used by data scientists and analysts to build iterative models that produce insights and suggestions
and help people make decisions.
Insight; Insights from the analysis are provided through dashboards with visualizations, exposing
unanticipated differences in the performance of the digital twin and the physical world model at one
location. or multi-dimensional, and they might highlight areas that require additional scrutiny and
modification.
Act; To fulfill the goal of the digital twin, this stage enables the actionable insights to be collected and
transmitted back to the physical asset through the digital process. After passing through the decoder, the
data is sent to the asset's process actuators, which are in charge of the movement or control mechanisms,
and is subsequently updated in back-end systems that control the supply chain. response control and
behavioral management affecting people. The closed loop connection between the physical world and
the digital twin is completed by this interaction.
2.4.5 DT Benefits
From Autodesk's perspective, Using digital twins, it is possible to see an asset from many different
angles, including how it is used, how it is used, how much space is being used, and how traffic flows
through it. A digital twin offers a method to explore "what-if" scenarios, such as the ramifications of
15 Dorji, T. 2022. Theoretical application.... framework for DT for operation and maintenance phase
 Master Thesis Ljubljana, UL FGG, Second cycle Master study Programme Building Information Modelling – BIM A+.
design modifications, adverse weather conditions, and security threats. It gathers a significant amount of
data in one location. The value from operations is exponentially improved, development effort is
reduced, and time to market is accelerated by creating digital twins of complex assets, factories, and
processes.
Figure 10. Benefits of DT (Own Works)
2.4.6 DT Foundational Technologies
To support DT creation, a variety of enabling technologies is required to be deployed. (Fuller et al.,
2020; Hu et al., 2021; Tao et al., 2019) proposed the following enabling technologies for DT;

2.4.7 DT Lifecycle Use
Tao, et al (2018) described how the digital twin concepts can be implemented throughout a product
lifecycle as summarized below;
Design Phase; Digital Twin Prototype (DTP) is utilized to evaluate how hypothetical assets will behave,
validate different design choices, ensure that the product meets standards, avoid failure, and maintain
product quality (Tao et al., 2018). The development of CAD software has enabled designers to produce
complex 3D models that can communicate clearly in a variety of settings, which has made the digital
twin feasible. Increasing simulation capability helps to ensure product quality, avert failure, and exceed
expectations. The DTP process includes stages for conceptual design, detailed design, and virtual
verification and highlights the benefits of testing a design utilizing information on the physical qualities
of clients, materials, equipment, and environments, as well as historical data from the most recent
generation before manufacture begins.
Build/Manufacture Phase; For the production stage, the concept of the digital twin is used to create
Digital Twin Store Floor (DTSF) by merging physical space and information space. (DTSF) supports
efficient production planning, resource allocation, and control of the manufacturing process. DT
architecture for this phase consists of Physical Shop Floor (PS), Virtual Shop Floor (VS), Shop Floor
Service System (SSS), and Shop Floor Digital Twin Data (SDTD). This DT framework allows the owner
to predict the outcome of the unit/shop through simulations of different situations enabling the owner to
choose the most optimized manufacturing solutions. Costly downtime of the factory can be avoided and

predictive maintenance can be made possible. This continuous flow of dependable information enables
more rapid, effective, and reliable production processes. (SIEMENS, 2020).
Operational/Service Phase; This lifecycle phase is defined by heterogeneous and extensive layers of
data that characterize the use and maintenance of the product and materials. An inefficient operation and
maintenance strategy will lead to the risk of costly failure and threats to the operator. DT concepts can
support proactive maintenance based on the strategic asset management principle such as using specified
material, and correct structural configuration as compared to the conventional approach of the run to
failure maintenance. (Tao et al., 2019) devised a framework based on real-time monitoring leveraging
cutting-edge hardware and network technologies, enabling data on energy usage, user behavior and
configuration, product performance, materials, component wear details, etc. Real-time and historical
data integration makes it easier for the service owner to comprehend the status of the operation,
including energy consumption analysis and forecasting, user management and behavior analysis,
operational guidance for users, intelligent optimization, and updating, product failure analysis and
prediction, and product maintenance plan.
2.5 Digital twin in the AEC Industry
It is evident from the preceding sections, the DT paradigm has gained significant traction in the
manufacturing and aerospace sector as a means to tackle PLM-related issues and foster greater
efficiency and productivity. On the contrary, the AEC industry is not able to fully embrace the DT
concepts and technology from the fourth industrial revolution due to industry fragmentation. However,
with significant technological advancement within the AEC industry, the concept of a digital twin is
being increasingly deployed throughout the lifecycle of Building and infrastructures reshaping the entire
industries. This chapter aims to analyze the cutting-edge DT concepts utilized by the AEC
industry throughout the different phases of its life cycle. Among the many industry players involved in
the implementation of the DT concepts and technologies, some of the most pioneering organizations
making significant contributions to the research and implementation of DT in the AEC sectors are
BuildingSmart, CDBB (Center for digital built Britain), and 4 years SPHERE project. The summary of
their notable contribution is discussed below;
2.5.1 Building Smart Perspectives
The building smart initiatives (bsi) (buildingSMART, 2022) contend that the adoption of DT
transformational technologies by the built environment can generate significant value (economic, social,
environmental, and business). However, to unlock the benefits of DT, the built industry should break
the existing organizational silos among the stakeholders and adopt collaborative practices. The
implementation of DT by the built environment will incur huge investments due to the paradigm shift
in technologies required. The built asset industry remains constantly challenged by demographic change,
Dorji, T. 2022. Theoritical application..... framework for DT for operation and maintenance phase 20
Master Thesis. Ljubljana, UL FGG, Second cycle Master Study Programme Building Information Modelling – BIM A+.
urbanization, and climate change in addition to the normal aging and renewals demands of an asset,
causing enormous cost and budget implications. These factors demand the built asset industry be more
productive and innovative throughout its lifecycle. To counter the pressure exerted on the poor
performance of the assets, data-driven solutions are viewed as one of the most potent means to optimize
business processes, manage capacity constraints, boost productivity, and ultimately drive organizational
performance (buildingSMART, 2022).
The primary mission of building smart initiatives (bsi) is to provide the platform for developing open
digital solutions and standards for the adoption of DT in the built asset industry. the organization
supports the industry by delivering an open international standard to enable digital ways of working and
ensures the successful implementation of the DT concept. Building smart believes that, with better data
management and governance and further integration with standardization, the digital twin of any system
can be easily created. (bsi) is also responsible for bridging the gap among the key organizational bodies
to integrate the technologies and align the schemas with IFC protocols. (bsi) focuses on technical aspects
(data exchange standards, protocol specifications), as well as vocabulary definition, business processes
definition, and common use case identification (buildingSMART, 2022).
Building smart describes DT as the digital replicas of physical assets across all phases of the PBO-I
(Plan-Build-Operate-Integrate) lifecycle. Digital twin aids in better planning and design during the early
stage of a project and provides optimization and productivity during the O&M phase. Enabling
technologies such as IoT sensors, artificial intelligence, and machine learning facilitate real-time data
exchange between the physical and digital counterparts and supports data analytics which enables better
decision-making and timely action. With connected assets, the ecosystem of a digital twin for the whole
built environment can be created to deliver greater value to the nation (buildingSMART, 2022).
For the AEC player to enable the adoption of digital twin concepts and technologies, (bsi) identifies
three critical areas of development which is essential for bridging the existing gaps listed below; (1) data
model standards – For collecting and production of data models to operate at various levels, several data
models are necessary. This ensures data interoperability between the layers and breaks the data silos. It
also enables open, secure, reliable data sharing throughout the industry stakeholders; (2) standards for
data management and integration – bind data science and information management together. The
standards integrate the data to achieve semantic precision; (3) data security and privacy – (bsi) as the
facilitator for creating the enabling environment provides a safe platform for data hosting and sharing
(buildingSMART, 2022).

2.5.2 CDBB's Perspectives
The Centre for Digital Built Britain (CDBB) is an organization instituted by the UK government to
digitize the entire AECOO sector throughout its lifecycle through the adoption of digital twin concepts
and technologies. SPHERE is a special purpose vehicle constituted under CDBB to undertake the four
years horizon project involving more than twenty partners to jointly develop the digital twin for the
design, construction, and operational phase of the building project.
The main objectives of (SPHERE, CDBB, 2020) are;
(1) To create an ecosystem of a digital twin for the entire nation referred to as National Digital
Twin. The network of connected DTs ensures better outcomes for the built asset environment.
The national digital twin will ultimately support the delivery of better performance, and quality
of assets, processes, and systems in the built environment.
(2) To create an information management framework that will enable secure, adaptable data sharing
as well as efficient information management.
(3) To create a Task Group for Digital Framework comprising people from academic institutions,
researchers, industry players, and government to share knowledge and findings.
One of the important contributions of CDBB is the publishing of Gemini Principles as guidance
documents for implementations of the National Digital Twin (NDT) project, Gemini principles provide
the best practice of building digital twins through the adoption of nine (9) values (9 main principles).

Master Thesis. Ljubljana, UL FGG, Second cycle Master Study Programme Building Information Modelling – BIM A+.
Figure 13. Gemini Principle (Lu et al., 2020a)
The information management framework plays a crucial role in the adoption of digital twins by fostering
a common unified language among the stakeholders to exchange and share the asset data efficiently and
securely in the machine-readable format. Since the DT requires capturing and exchange of data from
multiple sources, the information management framework standardizes the process of data capture and
exchange in a consistent manner leading to effective insight and decision-making processes (SPHERE,
CDBB, 2020).
To initiate the common definition of DT in the AECOO sectors, CDBB propose new definitions from
SPHERE for the building DT as appended below;

The value & sophistication of DT increases with the level of its maturity. proposed a DT maturity
spectrum as shown in Figure 16. Fundamentally, the level of DT maturity implemented should be
justified by the corresponding value generation. There are six levels of maturity. The execution of
maturity-level is not limited to linear development, sometimes twins at lower maturity levels may exhibit
the characteristics of the higher DT, The maturity ranges from element 0 to element 5.
According to Vertantix, the level of digital twin's sophistication is illustrated in figure 17.
Figure 17. Level of DT sophistications (Autodesk, 2021)
The level of sophistication/maturity of DT is dependent on the volume and caliber of data gathered from
the physical twin and its surroundings, according to Singh et al. (2021).
Partial DT: A small number of data points, including pressure, temperature, and humidity, are used to
assess the connectivity and functionality of DT.
Clone DT: It contains all crucial details about the system or product that may be utilized to make
prototypes and categorize various development stages.
Augmented DT: It utilizes both historical data and data from the asset, and while doing so, it also makes
use of algorithms and analytics to synthesize and correlate the relevant data.
The acquisition of more data sets throughout the operation can increase DT complexity. (Azad M. Madni
et al.) categorized DT into four levels as follows;
Pre-Digital Twin: DT is created before the creation of the real product to make decisions concerning
the designs of prototypes, reduce technical risk, and identify potential problems.
25 Dorji, T. 2022. Theoretical application.... framework for DT for operation and maintenance phase
 Master Thesis Ljubljana, UL FGG, Second cycle Master study Programme Building Information Modelling – BIM A+.
Digital Twin: This level incorporates information about the performance, maintenance, and condition
of physical assets. This information is used by the virtual system model to support high-level decisionmaking in asset design and development as well as maintenance planning. At this level, data
transmission is two-way.
Adaptive Digital Twin: Level three uses supervised machine learning to take into consideration the
priorities and preferences of human operators and provides a configurable user interface for dealing with
the physical and digital twins. With the aid of this DT, real-time planning and decision-making during
operations is possible.
Intelligent Digital Twin: Level four adds unsupervised machine learning capabilities in addition to the
features from level three. A system's analysis can be carried out more precisely and successfully by
integrating it with reinforcement learning, which may help uncover patterns in the operational
environment.
2.5.4 Comparison of BIM and Digital Twin
Data generated during the planning and design phases are incorporated into the BIM process. The asset's
development and operation are also covered by the digital twin, which can potentially help with future
project planning and design. Multidisciplinary models in the core, together with the integration of
systems and data across processes and between organizations, are necessary to fully realize the potential
of the digital twin. The quickest way to create a precise, valuable digital twin is through BIM.
BIM platforms were developed in response to the need for effective IT tools for design, and the processes
have evolved to fulfill the need for digital prototyping in construction, allowing testing of both design
and production aspects before construction (Feng, Haibo et al., 2021; Sacks et al., 2020). Many
practitioners see BIM as the core technology enabling the construction of digital twins (Sacks et al.,
2020), Though so-called "as-built" BIM or "Facility Management" (FM-BIM) models (Teicholz, 2013)
include details about the status of facilities when they are put into service, they fall short of the digital
twin concept of continuously updating the representation of a facility's current state. The goal of "asbuilt" models, also known as the "asset information model (AIM)" in ISO 19650, is to give owners
models for the operation and maintenance phase. These models are typically reactively compiled after
execution. They are not intended to provide the short cycle time feedback needed for project control
(Sacks et al., 2020). To show the actual reflection of the physical assets at any given time as in line with
the digital twin modeling concepts, the BIMs need to be continuously updated using the information
collected from the sensors or ubiquitous IoT devices. However, there has been a lack of efforts to connect
BIMs to digital twin models (Feng, Haibo et al., 2021).
Dorji, T. 2022. Theoritical application..... framework for DT for operation and maintenance phase 26
Master Thesis. Ljubljana, UL FGG, Second cycle Master Study Programme Building Information Modelling – BIM A+.
Furthermore, the BIM-compatible predictive simulation and analysis tools are intended for use in design
rather than project execution. Predictions of the future performance of the built product are made using
applications for structural engineering, ventilation and thermal performance, lighting, and acoustics.
When performing "4D CAD" analysis of project schedules using BIM models, critical path approach
tools are employed, although these are not appropriate for production control (Sacks et al., 2020).
Although BIM systems offer excellent representations of product designs, they lack the necessary
elements for construction utilizing digital twins. (Sacks et al., 2020)
Figure 18. Comparasion of BIM & DT (Davila Delgado and Oyedele, 2021)
However, according to (Quaye, G.M, 2021), BIM is one of the foundational processes on which
digitization in the AEC sector is made possible and scalable, The digital twin is regarded as a concept
rather than a technology and it relies on many enabling technologies to generate a value. A BIM model
is a 3D model with abundant semantic data that acts as a database for all assets and streamlines and
standardizes information flows between stakeholders during the delivery phase. BIM model and Cobie
data act as a repository of asset data during the operation and maintenance phase (Lu, et al., 2020).
However, BIM application in the O&M phase is still at an early stage and requires significant
development for integrations. Currently, the Cobie data format is the only means to integrate BIM in the
O&M phase. According to research findings, there are many limitations associated with the lack of BIM
application and integration in the O&M phase, some of the notable issues are summarised under
organizational - the lack of awareness of BIM use in the O&M phase; technological – lack of monitoring
integration of BIM-IoT's; the informational-the legacy format of BIM not supporting the integration of
BIM with IoT's technologies. However, with the adoption of BIM level 3 in the future, most of the
integration issues faced can be eliminated.

Figure 19. BIM maturity wedge (Quaye, G.M, 2021)
Recognizing the limitation of BIM in the integration of the O&M process, CDBB proposes DT concepts
to overcome the integration issue with BIM models. DT supports the integration and interfacing of BIM
data with the services delivery processes, in a secure information landscape. DT provides flexibility in
information integrations and modeling with analytical capabilities which are not possible with the BIM
process. Further, DT adoption can also enable prescriptive and predictive maintenance during the O&M
phase. The broad relationship between BIM and DT is illustrated below by (Bart Brink, 2020)

3 LITERATURE REVIEW – STATE OF ART
The definitions of digital twin are specific to the industry domain, Fundamentally, "A digital twin can
be defined, as an evolving digital profile of the historical and current behavior of a physical object or
process that helps optimize business performance" (Deloitte, 2020). The application of intelligent
operation and maintenance strategies, that utilize enabling technologies such as BIM, IoT, ML, and AI
capabilities, offers huge benefits to the AEC industry. Many research findings have illustrated the
application & benefits gained from the implementation of DT process during the O&M phases,
However, many challenges are encountered while implementing the digital twin concepts during the
O&M phase. According to a study conducted by Delloite, the most critical knowledge required for
implementing a digital twin process is determining the appropriate level of detail in a DT model. Both
complex and simple DT models will not yield their true value and incur significant costs to the asset
owner. This chapter performs the literature analysis on the state of the art of the Digital Twin concept
and identifies practical applications in the real world, particularly during the O&M phase. The following
research questions are formulated to find the appropriate solution to create the right level of DT for the
O&M phase.

3.2 Review of DT Application and Solution used - O&M phase
Review Article 1 - Digital Twin Hospital Buildings: An Exemplary Case Study through
Continuous Lifecycle Integration - (Peng et al., 2020)
Hospital overview screen; A large display screen showing the overview of the hospital operation and
maintenance system is set up in the control room which provides the overall visualization of the critical
information required for daily checking by the facility manager.
Space management; The spatial information of rooms and corridors was created for effective hospital
space planning, supporting room allocation, statistical analysis, and other tasks in the 3D view and list
view. This gives each medical department's use rate as well as the proper positioning for the maintenance
staff, and the effectiveness of space use was evaluated in light of how the hospital operates (Peng et al.,
2020).
Energy management; For monitoring energy consumption such as water and electricity, consumptions
are segregated to based on usage for different purposes and locations Both the total energy consumption
and individual consumptions (by category) are displayed in the graphic platform with color-coding
(Peng et al., 2020).
Facility management; There were displays representing each system's physical structure, logical
organization, and key facility information. The operating status and alarm status of each device are
shown in the 3D model view during rough seamless docking with BA. The technology allows the
backstage management staff to easily understand the operation of all important machinery and assess
their performance by displaying the historical monitoring data of each monitoring point as a list and
trend chart (Peng et al., 2020).

Master Thesis. Ljubljana, UL FGG, Second cycle Master Study Programme Building Information Modelling – BIM A+.
Repair and maintenance subsystem; This serves as the DT system's service windows, enabling users of
any level to easily initiate and handle repair requests or maintenance schedules. This subsystem's DT
service consists of work order generation, processing, job assignment, emergency repair initiating, and
maintenance calendar. Through fault diagnosis modules, maintenance actions can be carried out
according to the real circumstance triggered by a human or automatic system. The DT module helps
with accurate fault location, which boosts the effectiveness of equipment maintenance and emergency
repairs (Peng et al., 2020).
Security subsystem; By connecting with the hospital's video monitoring platform, the platform was able
to combine all security cameras. The DT control center would immediately alert security guards on
relevant floors as soon as medical dispute staff entered the field of any security cameras using the
security subsystem, which would also trigger facial recognition warnings based on their photo profiles
(Peng et al., 2020).
Guest flow management; a real-time guest flow can be tracked based on a facial recognization camera
mounted on each entrance. The system calculates the guest flow rate at the set time using ETL
processing. As soon as it exceeds the threshold limit set, the warning is initiated informing the security
personnel on duty. Vehicle flow can also be traced based on numberplates to determine car flow rates
(Peng et al., 2020).
Abnormal electric usage detection; The k-means cluster method was used to automatically classify the
data from smart meters, which showed that the amount of electricity consumed in hospitals varies
depending on location. To check the unidentified consumption pattern, this process is entirely automated
and unsupervised. Data based on at least seven different types of typical consumption are collected, and
corresponding smart meters are recognized. The DT system continuously monitored the power usage
and identified any anomalous meters that exceeded or fell below the 20% threshold from corresponding
normal behavior. On a huge screen, abnormal circuits were displayed, and a mobile app invited users to
perform check activities for the rapid maintenance of damaged lines and circuits (Peng et al., 2020).
Air-handling unit fault prediction; Faults are located using information from repair records and the
monitoring system, which uses data collected over 24 hours. Long-Term and Short-Term Memory
(LSTM) networks were used to learn prediction rules from time-series data because they have a flexible
memory and can follow anomalous data changes over time. the LSTM prediction model encompassed
10 different types of failures, including overheating and undercooling, low airflow, blocked filters, and
others. The data warehouse, on the other hand, is constantly updated with the most recent 24-hour
monitoring data for all AHUs. An early warning would be given in the system and mobile app if the
anticipated failure probability was more than 0.6 (Peng et al., 2020).

Frequent repair pattern recognition; The method allows for the automated analysis of all repair and
maintenance records to identify the pattern of performed fixes and identify the underlying causes of
recurrent failure. The system automatically groups comparable repairs into repair patterns, which were
appended to the monthly report. The extracted information included repair floor, department, room, and
type of damage. Optimization decisions would be made by managers when they discovered significant
trends (Peng et al., 2020).
Low-quality maintenance checking; The DT system makes it possible to keep track of each piece of
equipment's maintenance history as well as the identities of the contractors who perform that
maintenance by utilizing the t-test hypothesis testing technique. If the mean value of the repair amount
sequence following maintenance was higher than it was before maintenance and statistically significant,
the quality was deemed low (Peng et al., 2020).
Review Article 2 - Digital twin-enabled anomaly detection for built asset monitoring in operation
and maintenance - (Xie et al., 2020)
A case study at the University of Cambridge's West Cambridge campus to demonstrate how the
designed data structure can support the data integration of dynamic DT buildings and anomaly detection
function. The study showed that the DT platform gives facility managers and other associated
stakeholders access to asset monitoring services by analyzing existing anomaly detection modules, and
professional expertise and by establishing interaction between the real and digital worlds. The DT
system's primary objective is to provide FM personnel with intuitive information, visualization, and
decision support, by using the IFC schema and intelligently analyzing these data in a systematic
manner. The embedded DT instance implements the intelligent extraction of pump-relevant data and
sets off the alarm when the anomaly detection technique detects any potential aberrant behavior for the
investigated pump. With the capacity to store and analyze BIM object-related data gathered via
heterogeneous data sources, the embedded DT instance may store and analyze data related to BIM
objects (Xie et al., 2020).
During the O&M phase, it is discovered that an anomaly detection system is required to identify
abnormal pump behavior before it causes any catastrophic consequences as a result of its failure. Since
it takes a lot of experience to manually identify anomalies, DT platforms fully equipped with machine
learning and artificial intelligence ought to be able to distinguish between various patterns obscured in
operational data (Xie et al., 2020).

The author proposes a dynamic digital replica of a city level with DT sub-systems (building, bridges,
transportation, etc). This DT architecture links diverse assets and data sources with their applications,
facilitating intelligent asset management, delivering efficient O&M management, and further bridging
the gap between human relationships with buildings and cities through more intelligent, transparent, and
sustainable means (Lu et al., 2020).
The idea of a DT-enabled smart city was proposed in recognition of the important role that citizens play
in urban and city development. This smart city will involve residents and acquire vital feedback on
important urban planning and policy through the internet network. (White, et al., 2021)
Review Article 4 - BIM-Based Digital Twin and XR devices to improve maintenance Procedures
in Smart Buildings- (Coupry et al., 2021)
BIM-enabled asset management lacks predictive capabilities, Therefore, BIM-based DT uses “Extended
Reality”.(XR) devices can improve maintenance operations in a smart building. The applications of
BIM-DT -XR for maintenance improvement are explained below;
XR device helps to locate or identify specific equipment at the site during maintenance procedures based
on data of equipment from a centralized DT or a BIM to identify its location. Devices such as Hololens
headsets combined with detection algorithms to facilitate the localization and identification of
malfunctioning elements even if the maintenance equipment is hidden or concealed. It can also be used
to display specific documentation, such as a 3D representation of an ultrasound inspection. Further
through the use of documentation or maintenance instructions, such as equipment documentation or
maintenance instructions. Through the use of specific filters, only needed information can be displayed
preventing the overflow of too much information to the operator. The use of AR or MR argumentation
helps to display specific information over or near the equipment and can help the operator to better
identify faulty equipment (Coupry et al., 2021).
Centralization of data made possible by DT enables all stakeholders to access the operation data and
analyze the data which can be eventually used for predictive inspection purposes. Sometimes if the
operator requires assistance (information related) during certain maintenance tasks due to complex
procedures involved, Collaboration then becomes synchronous as it is carried out in parallel with
maintenance operations. With the use of video calls and augmented virtual annotations, communication
between operator and remote expert can also be established creating a real-time augmentation. After the
maintenance procedures, inspection and maintenance reports can also be shared among the stakeholders
(Coupry et al., 2021).

3.3 Review of Enabling Technologies Deployed For O&M phase
This chapter examines some of the top important technologies that were deployed in the creation of the
DT from among the selected research papers. This review also contributes to the knowledge base for
DT creation in the O&M phase.
3.3.1 BIM (Building Information Modelling)
BIM process not only enables digital representation of the building and civil infrastructure but also
allows the exchange of Building information effectively among the stakeholders following the unified
digital norms. BIM has considered a central repository or database for information exchanged during
the design and construction phase of the building and infrastructures (Lu et al., 2021). However, BIM
usage in the operational phase has been found limited due to its inability to integrate the dynamic and
real-time data from the heterogeneous source. Currently, BIM level 2 use in asset management operation
and maintenance phase is at the infancy stage. The existing level of BIM supports the exchange of asset
information using the Construction Operations Building Information Exchange (Cobie) spreadsheet.
The future evolution of BIM into level 3 has the potential to integrate asset information more
dynamically. However, BIM at the current level still serves as the lowest common denominator for
building DT due to its ability to host static asset data, accurate representation, communication, and
monitoring, and easy retrieval of information about buildings and infrastructure. Apart from exchanges
of asset data using the Cobie format for the operational and maintenance phase, BIM also provides the
3D model for visualization of an asset in real-time when integrated with DT architecture. According to
(Quaye, G.M, 2021), BIM limitations in the DT process manifest in technology-related challenges,
information-related challenges, organizational challenges, and standard-related challenges.
One of the effective methods to create a digital twin in the operation and maintenance phase is
demonstrated by (Lu et al., 2020b) using the IFC schema from the BIM model. Industry foundation class
(IFC) supports interoperability of BIM models with other systems using the open BIM concepts due to
its flexibility and consistency of the IFC schema in the building lifecycle as one of the primary BIM
enabling capabilities. However, the limitation of the IFC schema for operation and maintenance activity
poses a problem to utilize the BIM with many O&M systems. Therefore, extensions to the current IFC
schema to support the O&M activities are required. This IFC schema designed for operation and
maintenance task were integrated by linking the BIM object's unique identifier (GUID) with other
relevant data sources such as CMMS or AMS (Quaye, G.M, 2021).
(Heaton & Parlikad, 2020) propose developing an Asset Information Model (AIM) from IFC BIM
models (Architect, structural, MEP), an external database that collect and host data from other sources.
For the AIM integration, a functional-based classification system (UNIClass) is used for the
Dorji, T. 2022. Theoritical application..... framework for DT for operation and maintenance phase 38
Master Thesis. Ljubljana, UL FGG, Second cycle Master Study Programme Building Information Modelling – BIM A+.
decomposition of an asset from the project level to the component level. AIM relational database pulls
data from BIM models and external data sources. Finally, AIM federated model is integrated and linked
to the IFC BIM models, relational database, and point cloud data to form the digital twin platform.
Most of the buildings in Europe are constructed are before the 1970s when BIM models of the building
did not exist. Therefore, for those buildings and infrastructure without BIM models, advanced
technologies such as aerial photography, laser scanners, and photogrammetry techniques are used to
capture the 3D building models using the Point cloud generated by advanced surveying equipment.
These point cloud data are stitched to form the As-is BIM model (Peng et al., 2020).
3.3.2 Internet of Things (IOTs) and Sensors Technologies
The current practice of facility management in the O&M phase uses the BMS system such as BAS &
CMMS system. These are proprietary software building management systems pre-programmed where
the settings of sensors and alarms are preset on maximum and minimum threshold parameters. BMS
systems are not designed for integrations of real-time operational data coming from multiple sources.
This limit the capability of such a system to perform intelligent maintenance functions such as fault
detections, and predictive & prescriptive maintenance (Lu et al., 2020b). However, with advancement
in technologies like the internet of things (IoT), Wireless enabled sensors supports the collection and
transmission of data from various sources. WSN allows data acquisition from distributed sensor
networks through gateways and HTTP for monitoring and capturing the status of the physical
environment and individual equipment within the system. Common usage of sensors in the operational
phase of building includes monitoring and recording of the following parameters; indoor & outdoor
temperature, relative humidity of the air, and equipment statuses such as speed, vibrations,
temperatures, and pressure. (Lu et al., 2021) deployed following WSN abilities; to collect & upload data
from diverse locations; can support a large number of assets allowing scalability and flexibility;
affordable and readily available; perform analysis and control of resources and assets (Hallaji et al.,
2022).
3.3.3 Big Data & Cloud Computing
One of the biggest challenges of adopting Digital twin in operation and maintenance stages is the huge
volume of data (real-time data from sensors & user feed data by humans) coming from multiple sources
(Peng, et al., 2020). Therefore, to handle the significant volume of data, big data services powered by
open-source engines such as Amazon web service (AWS), Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, Kafka, and
Flink are necessary. DT process requires the continuous transmission and integration of sensor data from
heterogeneous sources with a significant volume of both static and dynamic data flow. The big data

analytics created at the backend consistently present high-density data streams due to their processing
power to adapt quick-flowing data streams from multiple sensors (Lu, et al., 2019). Further, to increase
performance, DT architecture should also incorporate big data and cloud computing.
3.3.4 Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning Algorithms
Machine learning algorithms such as k-cluster are used for the detection of abnormal electric usage, Air
handling unit defects can be predicted using long-term and short-term memory (LSTM), and opensource methods can be used to identify repair patterns that are repeated frequently. La Russa and
Santagati (2020) used artificial data sets and multivariate linear regression-linked machine learning
algorithms to create a Decision Support System (DSS). Unsupervised machine learning algorithms
(statistical approaches) including Moving Average (MA), Cumulative Sum (CUSUM), and Binary
Segmentation-based Change Point Identification Techniques were used to detect anomalies in
environmental data. (Xie, et al., 2020). The higher maturity level of DT requires the capabilities of AI
and ML to perform an intelligent predictive and prescriptive maintenance task.
3.4 Review of DT framework proposed for O&M stage
The findings from the literature review indicated, ''Digital Twin is a concept rather than technology''.
Although the fundamental principles of using the DT concepts are the same throughout the industries
irrespective of domains (aeronautical, manufacturing, and AEC sectors). The applications and
architecture layers of DT are slightly different in the industry. The process design (framework) of DT
concepts is significantly matured in most of the industries in contrast to the AEC industry. The
manufacturing industry has already developed standards and guidelines for building DT.

Digital twin application in AEC industries is at the evolving stage and therefore the knowledge area is
still at an early stage. Currently, there are no standards or guidelines to build DT in the AEC industry.
Based on the stages of DT implementations, the information requirements and framework are developed
in accordance with its purpose. In the O&M stage, although the DT architecture largely remains similar,
many authors have proposed different methods of building DT architecture/frameworks based on their
purpose. The application of DT in the O&M phase requires the integration of various enabling
technologies such as IoT, BIM, VR, AR, big data, cloud computing, artificial intelligence, machine
learning algorithms, etc. This section reviews the different frameworks proposed from the selected
papers and synthesis the knowledge to build a foundation for implementing the DT in the O&M phase
of building assets. The DT in the O&M phase should include the minimum basic aspects shown in figure
25.
The DT frameworks proposed for O&M of building asset systems are reviewed and analyzed;
DT Framework 1
This study analyzes present limitations and knowledge gaps in creating a dynamic DT at the building
level from data management perspectives. Based on a case study conducted at the west Cambridge site.
DT framework for developing dynamic DTs at building levels for the O&M phase is proposed. The DT
architecture integrates heterogeneous data sources, with a data modeling layer to support intelligent data
queries, and provides smarter decision-making processes. The framework proposed is based on five
perspective system architectures shown below;

DT Framework 2
This framework proposes DT-enabled asset management in the O&M phase. The BIM limitations from
the perspectives of both information richness and analytical capability in delivering efficient asset
management were the primary motivation for developing this framework. The proposed framework uses
smart asset management fundamentals and integrates DT technologies such as artificial intelligence,
machine learning, and data analytics to create dynamic digital models that can learn and update the
status of the physical counterpart from multiple information sources (Lu et al., 2021). The proposed
hierarchical based architecture of the DT-enabled asset management framework for O&M is illustrated
below;
Figure 25. DT-enabled asset management framework (Lu et al., 2021)
DT Framework 3
This DT framework is the outcome of research titled ''Digital twin-enabled anomaly detection for built
asset monitoring in operation and maintenance'' (Xie et al., 2020). The scope of this research is confined
only to the component level for anomaly detections of a pump. This DT framework uses extended

industry foundation classes (IFC) schema to integrate the operational and maintenance process for the
building assets. The DT architectural layer for this framework remains same as framework 2.

DT Framework – 4
(Zhao et al., 2022), proposed bottom-up approach for ''Developing a conceptual framework for the
application of digital twin technologies to revamp building operation and maintenance processes''. The
goal of this study is to promote the wider adoption of DT integration in the O&M phase by removing
the constraints caused by the misalignment of the data integration and data standards. It offers facility
management a bottom-up approach to DT implementation, covering the prerequisites, data collection
from multiple sources, processing, transmission, and modeling, model integration layer with different
intelligence tools, application, and data presentation layer.

DT Framework – 5
(Quaye, G.M, 2021) proposed a DT framework for O&M of building systems based on the state-of-theart research and expert consultations from the industry. The objective of the DT framework proposed is
to improve the productivity of building lifecycle costs through optimizing the operation and maintenance
activity. The DT architecture layers comprise five layers, data acquisition, data transmission, data
integration & modeling, and prediction and automation layers.

Since the DT is a concept rather than a technology, There is no standard process to develop the DT for
every instance. DT architecture in the O&M phase depends on the objectives of its applications.
Additionally, there are no standard guidelines available to evaluate the DT framework qualitatively or
quantitatively. Nevertheless, there are many similarities and best practices in terms of DT architecture
proposed for different application areas for the O&M phase. The components required for creating DT
in the O&M stage at the building level are summarized below;

4 METHODOLOGY FOR DEVELOPMENT OF DIGITAL TWIN FRAMEWORKS
This chapter deals with answering the key research question ''Practical application of a framework for
Digital Twins for O&M phases. To explain the steps and procedures involved in the development of
the DT framework for the O&M phase of assets in the building project, The framework development
process undertaken is illustrated in figure 31.
Figure 29. Development process of DT framework (Own works)
4.1 Background Review
The main research objective of this thesis is to propose the framework for the practical application of
DT in O&M of building assets. Currently, the AEC sectors do not have unified standards, processes,
and guidance documents for building DT for the O&M phase. BIM has proven its benefits in the building
design and construction phase, However, BIM usage in the O&M phase has been limited due to its
legacy format. The DT concepts and technologies available from industry 4.0 has enabled many AEC
practitioners to harness the potential of the digital twin in the asset O&M areas. With the advancement
of the digital revolution, the conventional ways of managing asset in the AEC industry has undergone
radical improvement. However, owing to a lack of standard and guidance documents for building DT
solutions in the AEC industry and also due to a lack of a unified process to implement the DT process.
Dorji, T. 2022. Theoritical application..... framework for DT for operation and maintenance phase 48
Master Thesis. Ljubljana, UL FGG, Second cycle Master Study Programme Building Information Modelling – BIM A+.
The DT adoption rate within the AEC sectors for the O&M phase remains sluggish. Therefore to
accelerate the adoption of DT in managing building assets during the O&M phase, the right level of DT
architecture, a clear process of information requirements, and DT deployment are necessary. This
chapter proposes the right level of DT framework for managing building assets during the O&M phase.
The first task initiated for the development process of this framework is an exhaustive literature review
which is already covered in the previous chapters. All the relevant DT concepts and architecture related
to the O&M of building service are also reviewed and analyzed.
4.2 Development of DT Requirements - O&M Phase
Figure 30. Development of DT information requirements process (Own work)
4.2.1 Smart asset management strategy
''Asset management refers to the coordinated effort made by an organization to generate value from the
asset'' (ISO 550001). According to IMM (Institute of asset management), a "SAMP is a planning tool to
clarify intentions, priorities, and practices to be adopted". It takes a long-term view and considers the
combination of organization needs, stakeholder expectations, and the conditions of existing assets and
asset management capabilities”. Smart asset management refers to the ability to readily provide
information about the asset, provide up-to-date asset performance and historical information, and
generate knowledge based on advanced data analytics and decision-making.
The ultimate objective of asset management is to achieve the optimization of service, cost, and risk
throughout the asset lifecycle. Research findings show that the O&M phase of any asset covers the
majority of its lifespan and therefore accountable as a significant cost factor. The changing
demographics and climate change have further aggravated the pressure on the built environment to
improve the ways asset is managed. The environmental, social, and economic outcomes are changing at
a rapid pace correspondingly. This has driven the world to rethink the current asset management process

and make it more productive to adjust to the changing requirements. Effective asset management plays
a significant role in delivering the functionality and serviceability of buildings.
Figure 31. Strategic asset life cycle decision support system (IAM, 2022)
Therefore, it requires a coordinated shift in terms of cultural and technological paradigms to adjust to
the changing requirements of the asset. Currently, there is a lack of holistic approaches and strategies to
manage the asset and its associated information that can help to monitor, detect, record, and
communicate operation and maintenance (O&M) issues. The digitalization of assets will enable better
decision-making and asset value management (better design, selection, and delivery of new assets)
through the usage of asset data such as behavior, and performance data (Papic and Cerovsek, 2019).
Therefore, structured asset data is seen as the single most important parameter to achieving smart asset
management. This data-driven asset management can transform from the current practice of siloed asset
management to smart and connected asset management through the implementation of digital twin
concepts and technologies.
(Papic and Cerovsek, 2019), proposed the ‘Smart Asset Management Maturity’ (SAMM) based on asset
management requirements from various sources like the Institute of Asset Management (IAM) UK
(2016), ISO 5500X series, the good practice developed by GFMAM (Global Forum on Maintenance
and Asset Management), etc. Smart asset management concepts integrate all three dimensions of the

organizational decision-making process, asset management principles, and technology management.
SAM enables predictive and prescriptive approaches through real-time data integration. Smart Asset
Management enables asset management organizations to make better decisions by working with up-todate, true and reliable information using processes enabled by the latest technology. It is concentrated
in various ways. The more efficiently information about assets is integrated, the more value you can
derive from those assets (Papic and Cerovsek, 2019).
Figure 32. DT Incremental maturity level (Mêda et al., 2021)
The strategy of achieving the smart asset is governed by the asset performance requirement against the
risk and cost. The decision support for choosing the right level of digitization should be based on the
maturity level of the digital twin required. The corresponding cost associated with digital technologies
implemented should justify the value gained (Measure objectives fulfillment against cost and risk).
Therefore, choose the right level of digital twin maturity model before the adoption of DT.
4.2.2 Develop Asset Information Model
In the previous section, the significance of data or information is deemed as the lifeblood of the asset to
create a digital twin in the O&M phase of building. This asset information is produced throughout the
lifecycle of the asset at various points of time and undergoes continuous updates in real-time or
periodically based on the level of complexity of the digital twin implemented. The data are produced
and exchanged among the project stakeholders throughout the lifecycle to produce the asset information
51 Dorji, T. 2022. Theoretical application.... framework for DT for operation and maintenance phase
 Master Thesis Ljubljana, UL FGG, Second cycle Master study Programme Building Information Modelling – BIM A+.
model (AIM) for the O&M phase. PAS 1192-3 defines AIM as ''data and information that relates to the
asset at a level required to support an organization’s asset management system”. This AIM is linked to
various enterprise systems such as asset management systems, sensor systems, and physical
environment parameters. Cobie data are derived from the Revit model during the BIM process and
linked to the building asset management system such as BMS, CMMS & AMS for operation and
maintenance functions. The process of information flow is illustrated below;
Figure 33. Asset information modeling process flow (ISO 55000-1, 2014)
There are many methods to produce the asset information model for the O&M phase depending on the
building status. For a new building project, the Asset information model requirements are defined in the
BIM execution plan (BEP) as per the information management process in figure 35. The information
management within the BIM process is designed to produce, exchange, and collect the asset data in the
required format, and passed to the downstream users for the fulfillment of the intended purpose. The BS
EN ISO 19650 UK BIM framework guidance for the delivery phase and operational phase serves as
guiding documents to produce the as-is asset information model;

Master Thesis. Ljubljana, UL FGG, Second cycle Master Study Programme Building Information Modelling – BIM A+.
Figure 34. Information Exchange diagram (ISO 19650)
The common data environment (CDE) hosts all the structure and unstructured asset data produced during
the project delivery phase. (The structured data are geometric data, alphanumeric, documentations, and
unstructured data are images, photographs, and meeting notes). The CDE also hosts the O&M data
produced and exchanged by various parties during the O&M phase. The CDE acts as a repository or a
single source of truth for the asset.
Figure 35. Information exchange process during the operation phase (ISO 19650)
For those existing assets without the BIM model or asset information model. Technologies such as laser
scanning and photogrammetry are commonly used for producing the object-oriented model (geometric
model) using point cloud data in Revit software. The non-geometric information of the assets system is

 Master Thesis Ljubljana, UL FGG, Second cycle Master study Programme Building Information Modelling – BIM A+.
updated based on the level of information needed by its purpose. The O&M data are either collected
through user feedback or real-time data feed from sensors system integrated with the asset. According
to (Heaton and Parlikad, 2020). The BIM IFC model quality is checked using the BIM collaboration
format (BCF) and internal model mappings for the building level and room/space with the asset system
and components are done using solibri model checker tools. The final approach after producing an asset
information model requires the following steps to support the DT in the O&M phase (Heaton and
Parlikad, 2020).
(1) Classification of assets within a BIM model, based on their functional output.
(2) Development of an AIM relational database, that is derived from an exported IFC model.
(3) BIM models linked to a relational database within a single federated model.
Figure 36. Asset classifications & AIM process for DT (Lu et al., 2021)
4.2.3 Develop O&M Information Requirements
One of the key aspects of DT architecture is data interoperability, integration, and data modeling.
Dynamic DT of building assets in the O&M phase involves multi-domain and multi-layer information
storage, manipulation, exchange, and interaction (Qiuchen Lu et al., 2019). O&M data stored in building
information systems requires a significant amount of time to search, query, verify and analyze the
corresponding facility information from heterogeneous data sources (Qiuchen Lu et al., 2019).
Construction operation building information exchange data format (Cobie) is one of the common
information exchange national standards adopted by the AEC industry for the integration of BIM and
O&M systems. The Cobie allows the data exchange from the BIM model to CMMS, BMS, & AMS for
the O&M phase. However, the Cobie spreadsheet can only represent partial O&M information and is
therefore ineffective for creating adequate DT. The limitations are; model validation after the
information exchange is needed; user-friendly information save and query approaches and formats are
required; clear classification strategies of assets in O&M phases (e.g., sensors and control points) are
needed to avoid misunderstanding of various O&M activities (Qiuchen Lu et al., 2019). These issues
Dorji, T. 2022. Theoritical application..... framework for DT for operation and maintenance phase 54
Master Thesis. Ljubljana, UL FGG, Second cycle Master Study Programme Building Information Modelling – BIM A+.
with the conventional approach highlight the need for an intelligent and comprehensive platform to
integrate and efficiently search information, support decision-making, and promote automated and semiautomated procedures.
The other process to exchange the O&M information is using the industry foundation class (IFC). IFC
schema is an open data format that supports a wider range of data exchange for interoperability. For
effective integration of information to achieve smart asset management, a standardized, unified, open
data schema is necessary for the O&M phase. IFC schema is flexible and the most suitable data schema
for wider BIM implementation and information integration for the DT process. Therefore, a possible
and effective solution for representing IFC schema and integrating information is to provide a
centralized data model linking with distributed data resources in daily O&M management.
However, the existing IFC data schema for operation and maintenance does not support all the O&M
events. There are no entities in the existing IFC 4 schema to specifically represent information and
activities in O&M phases. Therefore, it is a prerequisite to developing missing IFC entities subclass,
types, and parameters. Specific O&M processes and tasks involved for DT should be provided, and
maintenance and inspection processes need to be defined. Following are some of the important new IFC
entities required;
Table 7. IFC extension for O&M activity (Lu, Xie, Parlikad, et al., 2020)
55 Dorji, T. 2022. Theoretical application.... framework for DT for operation and maintenance phase
 Master Thesis Ljubljana, UL FGG, Second cycle Master study Programme Building Information Modelling – BIM A+.
Other information required related to O&M activity are cost breakdown information of components and
spare parts, historical records, maintenance cost, and maintenance activities This information cannot be
directly linked with the asset information model (AIM) and therefore separately maintained and linked
through the GUID. However, the IFC requirements can be eliminated using proprietary software such
as Dalux FM, as this software has already integrated the O&M activity within their system.

et al., 2020)
4.2.4 BIM Model Requirement
The AEC industry follows diverse standards to develop information requirements in the absence of a
common framework. The concepts of (LoD) level of details, (LOD) level of definition, and level of
information have created more misunderstandings of the information requirements concepts rather than
providing clarity. Several LOD specifications are published, and practitioners adopt the specification
that best fits their understanding and established workflows, ideally as simple as possible and also
flexible enough to precisely capture their information needs (Abualdenien and Borrmann, 2022).
Therefore, to dispel the confusion created, the UK BIM framework has published the ISO 19650 – Part
D specifically for developing the information requirements through the level of information need

3. The Alphanumerical information to fulfill the purpose
4. The Documentation to fulfill the purpose
Since the level of information need is purpose-driven, The good practice is to set the contextual
background on which this information requirement is being developed (purpose).
4.2.5 Level of Information Need (LOIN) & LOD
According to ISO 19650 (D) for the level of information need, the information requirements are
developed using the guidance table below for the operation and maintenance of the building. The level
of information need is defined initially on the overall domain level (architectural, structural, MEP) rather
than on the object/element/component level. However, for some components/objects, the level of
information need is defined individually based on purpose govern by operation and maintenance
requirements.

4.3 DT Framework Development
4.3.1 Case Study
The case study was conducted for the Faculty of Medicine main building located at the Vrazov trg,
University of Ljubljana, Slovenia. The estate includes 1 main and one annex building (3 stories)
covering a 250 Sqm area comprising of the lecture room, laboratory space, faculty office, research and
laboratory space with individual LOTS (parking, flower garden, etc).
In line with the dissertation objectives, the case study is required to demonstrate the practical application
of the DT framework in the O&M phase. Based on understanding and knowledge gained about digital
twin concepts and frameworks through the literature review, It is conclusive that, implementing DT for
the O&M phase demands skills and knowledge from various fields. Many companies are providing
digital platforms to create DT solutions for the O&M of building service. Some of the major DT solution
providers are Autodesk Tandem, Ecodomus/Siemens, Microdesk, and Archibus. Dalux FM is one of the
proprietary software platforms developed specifically for the O&M phase of building. For this case
study, the Dalux FM platform is used for the demonstration of the DT solution for maintenance of the
ventilation system in the building project identified for the case study.
Figure 39. Scope of a case study (Own works)
Dalux FM platform is one of the established DT solutions built for O&M of building. The cloud-based
platform provides a comprehensive DT solution to perform user-defined O&M processes based on the
types of assets to be maintained. This platform integrates all the necessary DT architecture required to
perform O&M activity within its system. The DT implementation process for O&M of the ventilation
system in the building, using the Dalux FM is illustrated in sequence hereunder;

1. Location Modules
Based on the strategic asset management plan, the maintenance requirements are decided for each of the
asset portfolios. Dalux FM supports managing the asset located in various locations and regions from
one platform. The foremost process is to identify the geo-location of all the estate, buildings, and Lots
within the scope of the maintenance plan. The geographical information system (GIS) features are
integrated with the software platform to allow identifying and marking the exact location of each
building included in the maintenance project as shown in figure 45. The building system and components
are positioned relatively to their exact geocoordinates.

Figure 41. Geolocation of project & building in location modules
For any DT preparation, the BIM model or object-oriented model is essential. Based on the overall
purpose of DT implementation, This BIM model of the building, system & components is prepared as
per the level of information need (LION) and LOD. Prior quality check of all the relevant BIM models
(IFC format) is performed using configured rulesets to remove any discrepancies and inconsistencies
using solibri model checker. This includes clash detections within the same models and with other
disciplines. The critical parameters required in the BIM models are mapped and grouped using solibri
model checker. The metadata required for each component is also checked and ensures fulfillment. The
IFC output file from solibri is uploaded to the Dalux platform location modules, and 3D models
(architectural, structural, and MEP model) are uploaded and linked to the room and space of the building
footprint on its geolocation. 2D drawings of each floor are also placed corresponding to the floor system
of the building. Other project-related documents relevant to the maintenance activity of this building are
also uploaded and linked to individual systems and components. The uploading of the BIM model,
Autocad drawings, processing, and mapping is done within the Dalux FM.

The next phase is to set up the classifications and properties of all the ventilation systems of the building.
Since the scope of maintenance for this case study is only confined to the ventilation system, the major
components are mapped to the system, space, and building project. The asset in the Dalux FM are
installations, building parts, equipment, etc. The asset is used to create user-defined metadata, collecting
data, warranties, QR support, maintenance history and planning, placement, and analytics. All the assets
considered for maintenance activity are classified as per the classifications system (Uniclass/uniformat/master-format) and their critical properties are defined (heat, vibrations, speed, flow,
temperatures, pressure, etc). The classifications and properties of the ventilation system are defined
accordingly.
Figure 50. Classification and properties definition for a ventilation system (Dalux FM)
5. BIM & Documentations
BIM & documentation modules allow the linking of ventilation system components/products with the
maintenance process defined for the building. Using the BIM link or point cloud, each asset is classified
according to the classification system adopted. The assets can be captured from 3D models or the point
cloud data source. are filtered from 3D models for easy asset tracking and visualization during the
maintenance task/activity.

6. Helpdesk and Work order Modules
The helpdesk module supports reporting, generating, and assigning tickets and work orders to the
internal team or external stakeholders. This module binds all the maintenance process requirements
including people, process, GIS location, and asset models. Various types of maintenance (preventative,
replacement, mitigating, or service order) are carried out for the ventilation system. The general
maintenance process flow diagram of this module is illustrated below;
Figure 52. Flow diagram of the work order process (Own Work)
The reporters are the person identified and responsible for different maintenance areas or in some cases
building occupants/dwellers initiating the tickets. They tiggers the first instances of requirements for

 Master Thesis Ljubljana, UL FGG, Second cycle Master study Programme Building Information Modelling – BIM A+.
maintenance work in the form of tickets which are systematically forwarded to the maintenance/estate
manager. Depending on the nature of the maintenance work requested via the ticket received, the
maintenance manager reviews the severity of the maintenance task required and decides whether to seek
additional information from the reporters, reject the maintenance request or create formal work orders.
The work order is prepared in the work order template designed for the maintenance of that particular
asset. The work order consists of descriptions, site images, locations, deadline, cost, responsible team
members or service contractors assigned to responsible individuals from the team, and types of
maintenance work and priority assigned.
Figure 53. Workorder & tickets
The responsible person assigned to perform the maintenance task can seek additional information or
perform the work order issued to him. The responsible person updates the progress or completes the task
and status back to the reporter and manager who assigned the job. The time taken for maintenance is
recorded and informed to the reporter and maintenance manager for invoice and payment bookings. For
maintenance work outsourced to an external service contractor, the maintenance process remains the
Dorji, T. 2022. Theoritical application..... framework for DT for operation and maintenance phase 70
Master Thesis. Ljubljana, UL FGG, Second cycle Master Study Programme Building Information Modelling – BIM A+.
same. All the information is communicated to the team members and external contractors through email
messaging. The task can be updated anywhere through a mobile device or web login. The budget and
account module is also integrated with maintenance tasks to perform automatic invoice processing and
budget update.
The process of initiating, generating, and assigning recurring maintenance work orders is similar to the
normal work order process. The maintenance task is assigned to the internal team or external
suppliers/vendors for the scheduled period as per the service contract agreement. The option to connect
with the supplier portal is available on this platform. Invoice payment and budget booking for the
periodic maintenance are auto-generated based on periodic maintenance sheets submitted by team
members or external vendors.
7. Notification modules
This module helps to push the notifications to the internal team members and external vendors such as
manufacturers, and suppliers associated with the maintenance project through a service contract. The
ticket, work order, recurring work order, and supplier associated with the operation and maintenance
task are informed through push email, messages, call and other communication portal established. The
sample email message pushed by Dalux FM is shown;
Figure 54.Push message generated in Dalux FM
8. Userfield
This module supports the definition of miscellaneous user fields necessary for operation and
maintenance activity. The user field allows the creation of any additional fields with the desired value
which can be text, integers, URL links, options for the project, buildings, lots, area, company, contract,
ticket, work orders, products, rooms, documents, etc.

Figure 55. User fields (Dalux FM)
9. Budget
This module allows keeping track of invoices payments and budgets by linking the work orders and
recurring work orders completion with the budget plan defined within the system. The budget is
allocated for each maintenance type or building. The work orders are assigned with a predisposed budget
and the remaining budget available is indicated in budget modules. After completion of the maintenance
task, the economy is closed and the actual invoice amount is charged to the budget. The recurring work
orders book the budget automatically on the scheduled period and update the real-time budget status.
Finally, the project plans support budgeting for additional work required during the O&M phase for
renewal or refurbishment projects.
10. Integrations
Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), part of Microsoft Entra, is an enterprise identity service that
provides single sign-on, multifactor authentication, and conditional access to guard against 99.9 percent
of cybersecurity attacks (www.azure.microsoft.com 12/09/2022). This has the following functions;
Single sign-on simplifies access to your apps from anywhere; Conditional access and multifactor
authentication help secure data; A single identity control plane grants full visibility and control of your
environment; Governance ensures the right people have access to the right resources, and only when
they need it. Application programming interface (API) supports the interface of data from one platform
to another application as per requirements for higher DT functions (www.azure.microsoft.com

4.3.2 Result Discussion
As the objective of this study is to demonstrate the "Practical application of a framework for digital twin
during the O&M phase of the building". The state-of-the-art digital twin framework applied for O&M
of various building assets is examined in the literature review. The frameworks were closely evaluated
to identify the DT requirements; architecture layers, enabling technologies, and value generated for the
O&M phase. Additionally, the practical implementation of the DT for the O&M phase was conducted
using the Dalux FM software to understand the integrations of O&M activity with the DT architecture.
Another objective was also to identify the gap and limitations of DT capabilities for O&M functions
using the Dalux FM proprietary software and propose the comprehensive DT framework required for
the O&M of the Building system. The result of practical application is evaluated against each DT
architecture layer and the framework for practical application of DT for the O&M phase is proposed.
DT Architecture Layers
This DT framework architecture layer comprises five components applied in sequence respectively,
preparation layer, data acquisition layer, data processing & transmission layer, digital modeling,
integration & visualization layer, and application layer
Figure 57. Progressive DT layers
DT Preparation layer – This is the first layer to fulfill the prerequisite for DT implementation. This
layer is the most important step to define the scope of successive layers based on the objectives of DT.
As per Gemini principles, all DT should be driven by purpose in mind, This purpose informs the
preparation of prerequisites for the DT. The preparation layers review the asset management strategy of
the organization to select the best strategy required for the digitalization of assets to improve the
performance gap. Since the value of DT lies in the quality of data, the process of the information
management framework plays a crucial role in ensuring the flow of data in the O&M phase. The ISO
19650 (Delivery and operation) standards define the data exchange protocols. For the BIM model to be
used for the DT platform, the level of information need (LOIN) for each model (architectural, structural,
MEP) is defined in terms of geometric, alphanumeric, and documentation as required for the DT intent.
LOD of all the BIM components required for the operation and maintenance are prepared accordingly.

Data acquisition layer – This layer is the foundational step of DT, The sources for relevant data
required for DT are identified in this domain. This layer prepares the capturing of digital parameters
from the physical asset identified for the DT. The building operation and maintenance data are captured
and stored in a heterogenous manner in an existing system such as BMS, CMMS, and AMS. The goal
of DT implementation will determine which data to acquire from the heterogeneous sources. The BIM
models for existing buildings are captured by using technologies such as laser scanning, 3D point cloud,
and photogrammetry. This layer support data capture and upload from relevant building asset using
advanced techniques such as sensors, QR code, RFID, and imaging processing from the distributed asset
through IoT-enabled wireless communication, Wifi, and mobile services. Some O&M data are uploaded
through the user feedback platform. Other sources of public data that include weather and climate data
are acquired as per requirements.
Figure 58. Dalux FM O&M Integrations (Own work)
Data processing & transmission layer – This domain layer transform and transmit the data to the upper
layers. A significant volume of data is collected from physical assets and the environment during the
O&M process. Since this data comes in various forms (structured & unstructured), It requires
transforming the data to a useful and readable format by preprocessing the data or undergoing the cleantransform-store process. The O&M data generated every day from the sensors and O&M activity are in
massive quantity. Therefore, big data management services are required for transforming, processing,
and storing those data. This data management cloud service is currently provided by Amazon Web
75 Dorji, T. 2022. Theoretical application.... framework for DT for operation and maintenance phase
 Master Thesis Ljubljana, UL FGG, Second cycle Master study Programme Building Information Modelling – BIM A+.
Services (AWS), Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure. For the transmission of data from sensors
attached to the physical asset of the building, various communication technologies are available such as
LAN (Local area network), WAN (Wide area network), and 5G. Extract-Transform-Load (ETL)
technologies support the extraction of data from correct sources (physical assets), transform the data
into a common and readable format using business rules, and load the data into a warehouse for use in
the upper layer of DT.
Data/model integration & visualization layer – This layer is the most complex layer and is the kernel
of the DT architecture. This layer performs multiple critical functions such as data and model storing,
analyzing, integrating, processing, and AI-supported decision-making functions, etc (Qiuchen Lu et al.,
2019). The dynamic data analysis happens in real-time and processes the up-to-date as-is conditions of
the building asset including work order, current status, and historical information of maintenance
performed and future prediction of the asset. The integration of AI, ML, data analysis, and simulation
engines perform intelligent functions such as space & energy optimization, and O&M optimization. This
layer integrates external data of BIM models at a semantic level using IFC schema which supports the
representation of components, properties, and attributes and establishes a relationship with other data
sources using appropriate application program interfaces (API) such as Autodeskforge. For visualization
of model and data, dashboard displays of the model in a local computer or advanced AR/VR tools are
used for the detection of assets and faults associated with the asset and resources required for
maintenance.

5 DT BENEFITS FOR THE O&M PHASE
Successful implementation of the digital twin has the potential of unlocking economic, social,
environmental, and business value in the built asset industry (Quaye, G.M, 2021). The general benefits
of DT application in the O&M phase as per (Autodesk, 2021) are summarised below;
Some of the real values that can be derived from the implementation of this DT framework for the O&M
phase are;
• Reduction in faults and requested repairs through timely maintenance activities
• Advance detection of anomalies through analysis of sensor data from critical asset
• Prevention of downtime and catastrophic events using predictive maintenance capabilities
• Budget control, and reduction of O&M costs from prescriptive maintenance strategies
• Can perform preventive actions in the absence of qualified maintenance professionals, - a
systematic process with business intelligence.
• Effective environmental & asset monitoring to ensure that the working environment is
comfortable.
• Reduction in energy consumption cost – optimization control
• Engaged stakeholders to get valuable feedback on key planning decisions.
Optimized performance
Actionable insights, simulations, and a
connected view of all online and offline
data enable quick and better decisions to
optimize performance and efficiency.
Full view of all data
Eliminate data silos and unlock value
across a project’s lifecycle with all
historical data and real-time data in one
place.
Smarter predictions
With real-time sensor data and predictive
recommendations through machine
learning and artificial intelligence,
maintenance and operations are
significantly improved.
Faster results
Creating digital twins of complex assets,

6 LIMITATIONS & FUTURE WORK
Significant effort was made on literature analysis and evaluation of the state-of-the-art applications of
the digital twin in asset management for the O&M phase. The relevant papers available in the online
database are limited and most of the available papers pertain to digital twin applications in the FM-AEC
industry in general. These research articles are largely at an early stage of development and the practical
deployment of the framework is not addressed.
The contribution of this research work to the existing body of knowledge is limited. The DT framework
in this study is already being proposed by the previous researcher. The expert consultations and
interviews process could not be conducted to validate the practical usability of the framework. However,
the framework proposed is tested by implementing the O&M of the building system using the Dalux
FM DT platform. The result indicates the practical implementation of the DT framework for asset
management for the O&M phase.
Other limitations in terms of knowledge area include; Lack of standards for creating digital twins in the
AEC industry, especially for the O&M phase. However, references are made to digital twin standards
and guidelines available for the manufacturing industry and many other relevant BIM-related standards
such as PAS 1192, ISO 19650 – 3 for information management in the O&M phase, and ISO 55000
(1&2) for asset management.
Future works proposal includes; an in-depth understanding of asset management and synthesizing the
strategic AM principles embedded within the DT architecture rather than just patching the superficial
idea of AM to the framework process. For future scalability, DT-enabled asset management at building
and infrastructure and ultimately to the city-level need to be explored and developed. The only concern
of DT applications is the risk of data privacy and security. Therefore adequate measures must be taken
to manage and mitigate the risk. Gemini principle developed by CDBB, SPHERE provides the best
practice guidance to create the DT.

7 CONCLUSION
The AEC industry is constantly being challenged by poor asset management practices impacting the
productivity of the entire built environment. The demand and expectations to improve the entire value
chain of the built environment has become more urgent than ever before, triggered by global
interconnected socio-economic-environmental issue. Therefore, AEC practitioners have started
applying innovative means to improve asset management strategies by leveraging the power of digital
twin concepts and technologies which have become readily available from industry 4.0. The application
of digital twin concepts in the AEC sectors has gained significant traction over the last decades due to
the benefits it promises.
The AEC industry has already started to implement digital twin concepts and technologies discretely in
various phases to improve the performance and productivity of the building asset. The implementation
of digital twins enabled the AEC industry to improve its performance of assets throughout the lifecycle
which was limited in the BIM-based asset management process. However, digital twins being the newly
evolved concept from industry 4.0, there exists much confusion among the AEC practitioners regarding
the correct process of implementing digital twins for the operation and maintenance phase.
Consequently, due to a lack of clear understanding and guidance documents (standards), the AEC
industry is still unable to achieve the full potential and value from the DT adoptions in the operation and
maintenance phase of asset management.
This research study's goal was to develop the appropriate level of the framework for the practical
implementation of a digital twin for the operation and maintenance phase. The framework development
process entails performing a comprehensive literature analysis on the state-of-the-art digital twin
implementation in the O&M phase, the thematic applications area and the DT model were evaluated to
understand the system architecture and process utilized. The qualitative and quantitative analysis of the
selected framework was performed to identify the critical and non-critical components of DT
architecture. The limitation and knowledge gaps from the existing frameworks are also identified to
propose value addition wherever possible.
The proposed framework is verified at the University of Ljubljana, Faculty of Civil & Geodetic
engineering building operation and maintenance project, using ventilation systems as a topic for the case
study. Dalux FM is proprietary software used as a digital platform to demonstrate the DT solutions for
the O&M phase. The results indicate that The Dalux FM demonstration supported the corroborating
and validation of the framework architecture proposed and check the possibility of practical
implementation during the O&M phase. The observations made against each layer of the framework
proposed with the Dalux FM demonstrations also indicated that most of the architecture layers are fully
integrated to perform the DT functions seamlessly.

Although Dalux FM has proven the presence of most of the DT architecture within the system to perform
all the DT functions. Some limitations were also observed in the Dalux FM platform, especially for the
integration of a higher level of predictive DT solution using machine learning and artificial intelligence
are missing. The proposed framework from this study includes all the essential DT architecture layers
to create a digital twin solution for the operation and maintenance phase of any asset. The methodology
for developing information requirements, operation, and maintenance process flow, and BIM models
(Revit/IFC) are also presented as part of the framework proposal.
